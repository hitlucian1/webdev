		ISO 27005 is the international standard that describes how to conduct an information security risk assessment in accordance with the requirements of ISO 27001. 

Risk assessments are one of the most important parts of an organisationâ€™s ISO 27001 compliance project. ISO 27001 requires you to demonstrate evidence of information security risk management, risk actions taken and how relevant controls from Annex A have been applied.

ISO 27005 is applicable to all organisations, regardless of size or sector. It supports the general concepts specified in ISO 27001, and is designed to assist the satisfactory implementation of information security based on a risk management approach.
